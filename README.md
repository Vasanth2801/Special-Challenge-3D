# Special-Challenge-3D

I came with a idea of a james bond crossing a simple ground but if we steps wronglt then he will be fallen and killed 

The most fun part in building was the placing the design og the game where we have to place it correctly but also a little tricky to cross 


The main obstacle i faced is the player movement when i press the play button the chracter was not able to and tried it countless time 

if there was any extra time or another hour added i would add an colour changing blocks so it will even more fun to be more careful and adjusted the player movement
